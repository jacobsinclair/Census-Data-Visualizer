# Census-Data-Visualizer
An interactive visualization depicting census data from jails in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.
I used Object-Oriented program design to create a visualization that is easily accessible by users 
and can be queried by inputted demographics. The program can be adjusted for various sizes of data sets. In my implementation I used sets ranging from 10 inmates all the way to 2600+ inmates.

A large Dataset containing over 2600 inmates:
